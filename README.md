bootstrap-doc-starter
=====================

Documentation boilerplate powered by node, express, and bootstrap.

This project creates an expressjs powered website for documenting projects.

Getting Started
---------------

git clone git://github.com/jmandala/bootstrap-doc-starter.git
cd bootstrap-doc-starter && npm install
```

Run node to test it out.
